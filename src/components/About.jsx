      I’m Zahra Assar Enayati, a frontend developer with about 2 years of experience. I enjoy working with React to create dynamic, responsive web applications. One of my key projects is a shopping site I developed using React.js , Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, where I focused on building a seamless and efficient user experience. I’m always excited to learn new technologies and deepen my skills to stay on the cutting edge of frontend development.
