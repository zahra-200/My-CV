        My name is Zahra Assar Enayati, and I am a frontend developer with
        nearly two years of experience. I specialize in creating dynamic and
        responsive web applications using modern technologies, including React,
        Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. One of my most significant projects
        involved developing a shopping site where I focused on delivering a
        seamless and efficient user experience. I am deeply committed to
        continuous learning and strive to enhance my skills to remain at the
        forefront of frontend development.
